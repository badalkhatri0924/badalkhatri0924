## Hi, I’m Badal Khatri  
I’m a **Product Engineer** passionate about turning ideas into **scalable, user-loved products**. I bridge the gap between **engineering excellence** and **product vision**, building solutions that are technically robust, delightfully usable, and ready for market.  

I design and ship products end-to-end - from **AI-powered automation** and **multi-agent systems** to **web, mobile, and IoT platforms** - with a focus on **business value, user experience, and long-term scalability**.  

**What I Do Best**  
- Build **full-stack products** using **Next.js, NestJS, Angular, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Firebase, GraphQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB**  
- Integrate **AI/ML** for real-world impact - LLMs, RAG pipelines, agentic workflows, computer vision  
- Ship **IoT & Edge solutions** - MQTT, Raspberry Pi, low-latency control systems  
- Align **tech decisions with product strategy** to maximize adoption and ROI  

📫 **Let’s Build Together**
